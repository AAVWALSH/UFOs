# UFOs


### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to write that would create a webpage that would allow users to quickly search though UFO sighting data. This could be done by allowing users to input the search criteria of any number or combination of Date, City, State, Country, and Shape and it would return a table with the data that matched.


### Results
The result is a very easy to use webpage. It's rather self- explanatory and quickly returns the required info. 

### Summary
One drawback is that the data is static from the one data.js file. If an API could be set up to scrape new information that would be more up-to-date. 

One suggestion for increased usability is that inset of text input button there could be a drop-down menu of the possible options- as of this moment the user must follow the format provided i.e. az for Arizona, however if you didn't know a state abbreviation it would be ard to search. Also, the majority of the sightings are from the US so a drop-down would show what non-US sightings were included. 
Another suggestion for future improvement could be a field for new data to be collected from site visitors. I would imagine some of the people interested in this type of data might be because they have had their own sighting and want to know what it is or if others saw it. A map displaying the sightings would also be useful in helping see trends or clusters of sightings in a particular area- it's an exciting idea to chart the flight path of a UFO.
